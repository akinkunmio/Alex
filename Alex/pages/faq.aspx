                                <p>
                                    iQ is a online web application which enables schools to view, add, manage both staff and students easily. All you need is a iQ license and a device (Computer/Laptop/Tablet/Mobile Phone) which is connected to the internet to be able to use iQ.

                                <h4>How do I get help on using iQ?</h4>

                                <p>
                                    When your school signs up we will provide you with the initial training - all the basics will be covered in this tutorial. After this you can visit the iQ help page or contact your school administrator to raise a request with us. We can schedule training sessions whenever is convenient for you.
                                </p><br />

                                <h4>What happens when your school signs up?</h4>
                                <p>
                                   On our initial visit one of the things we will discuss is if you would like us to set your iQ system up or if you're comfortable setting up yourselves. Should you require us to do the setup we will then need some information from you regarding things such as school name, address, start dates and fees etc. After all the correct paperwork has been confirmed your iQ Account Manager will be in contact and they will explain the next steps.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Should you require us to set your school you will be required to fill in the 3 page form which will be accompanied with your welcome to iQ email. Once the form has been submitted our team will create your school system for you - then we will then be in touch with your own personal iQ link, along with your admin username and password. Also will be all the ways you can contact the iQ team, phone number, email address etc. This is all you need to get started on iQ. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                   If you do not require us to set your school up, your iQ welcome email will contain a 1 page form for you to fill in the basics of your school for our records, also there will be your schools access link to the iQ application as well as your admin username and password, finally it will contain information on everyway you can reach the iQ team. Once you click the link and login using the admin login credentials you are good to go!

                                <p>
                                    When you initially register with us we will ask you to provide contact details for your school, if these change you will need to contact your school administrator who will be able to do this for you via our settings page under the heading ‘school details’.

                                <p>At the moment there are 2 types of users. </p>
                                <p>Level 1 - This is a ‘super user’ they can see everything and do anything on iQ usually higher personal in the school including the application admin. </p>
                                <p>Level 2 - This user would usually be for office administrators, receptionists and teachers - who just want to add, edit and delete students and their related information. They are able to use most functionalities on iQ but unable to see the payment related reports and staff information. </p>
                                <br />
                                <h4>How do you report any bugs or make additional requests?</h4>
                                <p>Any user who finds a ‘bug’ with the iQ system should report to the school administrator - then they can escalate it to us by either raising a support ticket or emailing/calling us directly should the issue need urgent attention. </p>
                                <br />
                                <h4>How do you contact us in an emergency event?</h4>

                                <h4>How to use the assessments feature</h4>
                                <p>To use the assessments page firstly you need to assign a subject to a class - To do this go into the settings page and click ‘Assign subject to a class’ pick your class you want to set an assessment up for. 
                                    After clicking go you will see all the subjects which are available for an assessment (the subjects which you see can also be setup or deleted also in the settings page) using the square box on the left 
                                    hand side select what assessments you want to create for that class. To assign all assessments to a class click the box next to the ‘Subject’ column title clicking on assign will create assessments for the chosen class. </p>

                                <p>Next step is assessment weighting, this is how you input the weighting for each of the assessments. Some schools may not have 6 assessments so we have designed the page so you do not have to submit 6 assessments if your school only has 3 for example.</p>

                                <p>Once the weighting has been setup click the ‘Assessments’ sidebar menu, you will need to select the class and the subject - Only the available subjects will show for the class you select - 
                                    if there are no assessments available for a class you will need to go to settings to set up assessments. The assessment weighting will be displayed on the right hand side. Once you have selected the Class and the Subject the students will be displayed - to mark an assessment you need to go to ‘click to mark’, once you have put the scores you need to click ‘Save assessments’ - Please note that you will be unable to grade the student more than the maximum weighting, e.g. A student cannot get 70 marks if the max weighting is 50. </p>
