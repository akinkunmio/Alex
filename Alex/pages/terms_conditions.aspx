                                <p>
                                    Permission is granted for schools who have signed up to iQ. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license the school are responsible for how they use the application.

                                <p>
                                  The materials on Torilo's iQ web application are provided "as is". Torilo makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation,

                                    Further, Torilo does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its web application or

                                <p>
                                    In no event shall Torilo or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) 
                                    arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Torilo's Internet site, even if Torilo or a Torilo authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of 
                                    such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you. 
                                    Torilo will only upload the data which has been provided by the school.
                                </p><br />
