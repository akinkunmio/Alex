                                <h3>Creating and accessing an iQ account</h3>
                                <p>How to apply: In order to access and use The Service, an iQ account must first be created. 
                                    You can apply for an iQ account to be created by submitting your details on our "contact us" page or requesting an account from one of our sales representative or resellers.
                                </p>
                                <p>Formation of a contract: If we accept an application for the creation of an iQ account, we will confirm this by email and at that point a legally 
                                    binding contract will be created between the Account Holder and us. If you apply for an iQ account to be created, you must therefore ensure that 
                                    you are authorised to enter into this contract for and on behalf of the Account Holder. The contract will be concluded in the English language and the provisions 
                                    of these Terms of Service shall govern our agreement with the Account Holder and you.
                                </p>
                                <p>Errors in information you gave us: If you made any mistakes in the details you gave to us when applying for an iQ account, 
                                    these errors can be corrected by accessing The Service and using the "edit" function on the "School Details" page from the “Settings” menu.
                                </p>
                                <p>Refusal to create an account: We reserve the right, at our discretion, not to accept an application to create an iQ account. 
                                    This may be due to technical constraints, because you or your business has been banned by us from using The Service or for any other reason. No charge will be made by us for declined applications.
                                </p>
                                <p>How to access the account: You will not be able to access and use The Service without a username and password for an iQ account. There are two ways you can obtain these:
                               </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Once an iQ account has been created, we will issue the initial user (whose details were provided to us when the account was applied for) with a username and password.</li>
                                    <li>Additional users can obtain their own usernames and passwords if the initial user accesses The Service and uses the "New User" function on the "Settings" page.
                                        (Some subscription packages may have limitations on the number of additional users which can be added - please check our Pricing Page for details.)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        you should carefully assess whether or not you are happy with the assurances provided by the developer regarding your privacy and security. 
                                        You can disable API access to your iQ account at any time by modifying your account preferences.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We accept no responsibility for any loss suffered by you as a result of the use of any third party application to access The Service.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Paying for The Service</h3>
                                <p>Subscription fee amount: A subscription fee for use of The Service is payable monthly in advance by the Account Holder. 
                                    The subscription rates are detailed in your subscription contract schedule and we may vary these from time to time. Our prices are quoted in Nigerian Naira and exclude VAT, which is also payable. 
                                    Prices for our Universal Account are quoted in American Dollars. If you change your subscription package in the future, the change in the subscription payment amount will take effect at the next billing cycle.

                                    The Account Holder is not however entitled to benefit from more than one ‘free trial' - if we discover that more than one ‘free trial' 
                                    has been requested, the Account Holder will become liable for payment of the subscription fee for all use of The Service made after the first ‘free trial' period.
                                </p>
                                <p>Automatic renewal: Once any ‘free trial' or ‘beta trial' period is over, we will automatically renew the Account Holder's subscription and bill them every month, until the iQ account is closed.
                                </p>
                                <p>Non-payment: We shall be under no obligation to provide The Service if the subscription fee (plus VAT) is not paid to us on time. 
                                    The Account Holder must ensure that we have complete and accurate billing and contact information throughout the subscription period, including the full name of the Account Holder, 
                                    its business address, and a billing contact email address. If subscription fees become overdue, because for example the Account Holder's credit card has expired,

                                </p>

                                    the Account Holder and us regarding The Service, and supersede any prior understandings or agreements. The headings are for convenience only

                                </p>
                                <p>Third party features: In order to use certain optional features of iQ which relies on external data sources or embedded third party services 
                                    you will be required to accept the terms and conditions of the relevant third party provider. These will be notified to you within The Service at the point 
                                    of first use of the relevant feature and thereafter where those terms are subsequently updated from time to time, but currently include:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>automated access to Google Drive and Google Classroom</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>By agreeing to these terms and conditions you agree, if you use the relevant features, to be bound by the terms and conditions listed above 
                                    (and as subsequently amended from time to time) and any other third party terms subsequently accepted by you while using The Service ("third party terms"). 
                                    Any breach by you of the third party terms shall, without limiting any other remedy available to the third party provider, be deemed to be a breach of these Terms of Service.
                                </p>
                                <p>Changes to this contract: We reserve the right to change these Terms of Service from time to time and therefore we may impose new or different terms and conditions on your use of The Service. 
                                    These additional terms will be posted here on our website and will be effective from the Account Holder's next monthly subscription. 
                                    Therefore you should regularly review this page to check for changes to these Terms of Service. Your continued use of The Service will be 
                                    deemed to constitute acceptance by the Account Holder of all of the new terms. These Terms of Service may not otherwise be changed without our written consent.</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Waiver and severability: If either you or we ignore any breach of these Terms of Service, it doesn't mean that any further breach cannot be enforced. 
                                    Similarly, if any part of these Terms turn out to be invalid or unenforceable for some reason, then it will be replaced with a provision which, as far as possible, 
                                    achieves the same purpose as the original, and the remainder of the agreement will still be binding.
                                </p>
                                <p>Resolving disputes: These Terms of Service shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the State’s law. 
                                    If any party wants to take court proceedings in relation to The Service, it must do so in Nigeria. You are responsible for 
                                    compliance with any applicable laws of the country from which you use or otherwise access The Service.
